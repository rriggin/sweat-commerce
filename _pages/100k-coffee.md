> All I ever wanted was to run an e-commerce brand.  After running an agency for 10 years where we helped e-commerce brands with growth, I decided to invest in my own brands.  I got my face bashed in.  ðŸ¥Š

[BOOK A CALL](https://calendly.com/ryanriggin) and I'll tell you all about it. 


# About Me
What's up?  I'm Ryan.  I'm not an e-commerce guru.  If I've kept you reading this far maybe we have somthing in common.  I wanted my own brands.  I was tired of putting all of my energy into brands where I had no financial upside.  I can't tell you how many agency owners I've had that converation with.  Seems pretty common.  Last year, I invested in a couple of shopify / amazon brands in the apparel space.  Fucking brutal man.  It's an incredibly difficult thing to pull off.  I have so much respect for people who able to make it work.  I haven't given up.  We're still running the brands, growing sales and trying to build it.  But, I've lost some money.  I made simple mistakes.  Lots of them.  I've lost sleep over them.  Why didn't I catch that?  My losses could've been easily avoided if I'd just asked more questions.  Did more dilligence.  Had a better handle on the economics of the business.  But, whatever.  Shit happens.  What does all of this mean for you? 

# Offer
I will spend ONE HOUR on zoom with you for $5. If you don't get any value out of the call I'll buy you a coffee.  You can ask me anything.  Share anything about the business that you want.  We'll look under the hood together and I'll tell you what I see.  No strings attached.  

$5. The cost of a cup of cold brewed coffee from Starbucks, you can have someone who has taken a fat L in e-commerce save you a fortune.  I'm not here to bash your dreams.  If I think it's a good business, I'll tell you.  I don't give investment advice obviously ðŸ˜Ž.  But, I'll be honest about what I see.  

# Value Proposition
I'm not a guru.  I don't have all of the answers.  But I know what to look for.  I know what key questions to ask about the business.  Things like: 

- What is the cash conversion cycle? 
- Is the business first order profitable? 
- Are the CAC/LTV metrics consistent? 
- Does the brand have real engagement on social? 
- What are return rates like?
- How burnt is the email list? 
- What percentage of the sales on marketplaces are brand vs non brand? 
- Does the business own the marketplace accounts (i.e Seller Central)
- Who manages the tech stack and what is it? 
- Is there a full time operator running the business now and what do they spend their time on? 
- Are the trademarks and IP secure? 
- Does your supply chain compete with you in the retail market? If so, how?

> This list is endless. If you have questions ready we can dig into those as well.
